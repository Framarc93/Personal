# Intelligent Control for Access to Space (IC4A2S)


## Description
The Intelligent Control for Access to Space project is developed at the Intelligent Computational Intelligence Lab,
University of Strathclyde, Glasgow UK, by Francesco Marchetti, PhD student under the supervision of Dr. Edmondo Minisci and Dr. Annalisa Riccardi.

The project aims to develop an intelligent controller for Space Access Vehicles such as launchers or spaceplanes.
The main idea on which the controller will be based is to use a control law generated by a Genetic Programming algorithm which will be tuned online by an Artificial Neural Network in order to cope with sudden change in the environment.

## Repository Structure:
* Goddard_Problem : contains the intelligent controller developed on the Goddard rocket problem with both 1 and 2 control law
  * 2Controls: contains the scripts related to the Goddard rocket problem with 2 control laws
  * Testing: contains all the scripts under development
* GP_Experiments : contains various algorithms related to Genetic Programming
  * MGGP: contains a Python implementation of Multi Gene Genetic Programming
  * SNGP: contains a Python implementation of Single Node Genetic Programming
  * MGGP_SNGP: contains a "new" version of Genetic Programming which is an hybrid bewteen SNGP and MGGP
  * Benchmarks: contains an environment to test the different GP techniques


## Main libraries used (Python):
* DEAP: https://github.com/deap/deap
* TensorFlow 2.0 
* Scipy
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Multiprocessing


Other contibutors:
* Nicola Menga (visiting student from Polytechnic University of Turin from March 2019 to September 2019)
